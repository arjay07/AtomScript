Welcome to AtomScript!

`
AtomScript is an interpreted programming language.
`
Let's learn some basic syntax...
`
To define a variable use the '@' symbol like so: 

	@atomscript = "AtomScript";
`
To create a method, use the '$' symbol like so: 

	$foo(){

		# Place code here...

	}
`
Comments are placed using the '#' symbol:

	# This is a comment
`
Now let's create a simple "Hello World" program!
`
First, open up any text editor you have. (Notepad++ is recommended...)
`
In an AtomScript program, the method that is first called is the "main" method.
Type in the following:

	$main(){



	}
`
In your "main" method, insert the print method:

	$main(){

		print();

	}
`
Now create a variable outside of the main method that has the value "Hello world!"...
Your script should now look like this:

	@helloWorld = "Hello world!";

	$main(){

		print();

	}

Remember, that the variable can be named anything you want.
`
Now you have to modify your print method. Insert your variable between the paranthesis like so:

	@helloWorld = "Hello world!";

	$main(){

		print(helloWorld);

	}
`
To keep it from closing out on you, make sure you include this:

	io<in>();
	
This method makes it so your program doesn't close immediately after your code is executed!
`
You must also include the "io" object into your script. Go to the top of your script and do so:

	include <io>;

`
Your script should now look like this:

	include <io>;
	
	@helloWorld = "Hello world!";

	$main(){

		print(helloWorld);
		io<in>();

	}

`
Alright! Now that you've done that, save the file as "helloworld.atom".
`
Double click on the file and it should start running!
`
Awesome! You've learned the basics of AtomScript! Easy right?
`
Have fun creating your own computer programs!
