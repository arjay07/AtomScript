		<h1>About AtomScipt</h1>
		
		<p>AtomScript was especially designed to make programming easier. It uses syntax that is familiar and new at the same time. The project was started by Leandro Yabut (Founder of ZeroSeven Interactive) and is being developed by the AtomScript Team of ZeroSeven Interactive. The team's vision is to see that beginner programmers will be able to create computer programs and share it with the world with ease.</p>
